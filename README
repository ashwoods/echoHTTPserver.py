Quick and dirty HTTP echo server for REST requests using Gevent.
===============================================================

Based on gevent http example.

To use it you need libevent, which is already installed in many
nix environments, but:

libevent 1.4 only supports GET/POST
libevent 2 supports GET/POST/PUT/DELETE

to use just run:
    python echoHTTPserver.py

it prints to stout_
    METHOD URI POST_DATA

and returns a full RESPONSE.
the method and uri can be found in the header,
the response body is json data containing the POST_DATA
variables that was sent in the request.

Altough made for testing REST clients with simple data
its easy to change for other testing uses.

depends on:
    gevent : pip install gevent # needs libevent-dev to compile dependencies
